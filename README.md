This repository hosts my personal portfolio website built with React frontend and Express/Mongoose backend to handle the flight tracker page. The flight tracker can be found on the projects page, and is integrated with the Southwest-price-tracker to notify the user if a Southwest flight they have purchased can be rebooked to save money (Southwest allows rebooking and will refund the price difference if it is lower). For more information, please visit my site!
